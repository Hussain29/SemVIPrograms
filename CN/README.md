# Computer Network programs
Taught by Prof. Suresh Kumar

We had a 'date-time' program, an Echo Server program, a program to return a reversed string, sorting, and a sys call.

I've divided up the 5 main programs into folders, each containing 'server' and 'client' files named as such. 


# Programs and their descriptions-

- cp  
This is a program which is written in C, which is basically a rewrite of the shell program `cp`, used to copy one file to the other. It uses the `read` and `write` system call and the files are passed as command-line arguments.
